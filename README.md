# Simple-Calculator

I recently built a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during my short vacation. 

I am eager to undertake more projects that can enhance my skills and benefit my career. My goal is to develop practical and innovative applications that demonstrate my proficiency in web development. 

I am particularly interested in projects involving front-end and back-end integration, responsive design, and user experience optimization. 

Additionally, I plan to explore technologies such as React, Node.js, and databases to further broaden my expertise.

I have hosted it online using cloudflare.com website which enables us to freely host our websites online.
